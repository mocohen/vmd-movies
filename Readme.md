# Making movies in VMD

Making high quality movies in VMD is pretty simple. You should generally _not_ use the *MovieMaker* tool in VMD, and instead render each snapshot separately using a TCL script. This repository contains a number of examples for creating movies in VMD by first rendering each image, and then creating the video using ffmpeg.
